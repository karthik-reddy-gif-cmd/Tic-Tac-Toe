# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with either "X" or "O." In a web-based version, HTML provides the structure of the game board, CSS styles the visual elements (such as grid layout, colors, and animations), and JavaScript handles the game logic, such as alternating turns, checking for wins, and resetting the board.

- **HTML** creates the layout for the grid and buttons.
- **CSS** is used to style the grid, buttons, and display the "X" and "O" marks, ensuring the game looks neat and is responsive.
- **JavaScript** controls the interactive elements, including player turn management, win condition checks, and reset functionality when the game ends.

This combination of technologies allows for a functional, interactive, and visually appealing Tic-Tac-Toe game.
